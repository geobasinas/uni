# Code from the programming course from my university

Here is a short and concise README for your Python script:

## Main.py
### Quadratic Equation Solver

This Python script calculates the roots of a quadratic equation and performs additional computations based on the given coefficients.

## How It Works

- The script prompts the user to input values for coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- If `a` is even, it calculates the roots of the quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`:
  - If the discriminant is positive, it prints two real roots.
  - If the discriminant is zero, it prints one real root.
  - If the discriminant is negative, it prints two complex roots.
- If `a` is odd, it calculates the average of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

## Usage

Run the script and follow the prompts to enter the coefficients:

```sh
python main.py
```
